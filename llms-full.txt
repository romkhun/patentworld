### Chapter 14: Generalist vs. Specialist
Technology specialization patterns. Specialist inventors rose from 20% to 48% of the inventor workforce. Generalists earn 9.3 forward citations vs. 8.2 for specialists.

### Chapter 15: Serial Inventors vs. New Entrants
Career patterns and inventor survival. Annual first-time entries peaked at 140,490 in 2019. Only 37–51% survive past five career years.

### Chapter 16: Gender and Patenting
Gender composition and the gender innovation gap. Female inventor share rose from 2.8% in 1976 to 14.9% in 2025. Chemistry leads cumulative female representation at 14.6%.

### Chapter 17: Team Size and Collaboration
The collaborative turn and team size effects. Average team size increased from 1.7 to 3.2 inventors. Solo-inventor share fell from 58% to 23% by 2025.

## Act 4: The Geography

### Chapter 18: Domestic Geography
State-level and city-level patent concentration. California accounts for 23.6% of all US patent grants with 992,708 patents. States exhibit distinctive specialization patterns.

### Chapter 19: International Geography
Cross-border patterns and country-level quality. Japan leads foreign filings with 1.45 million US patents. China grew from 299 filings in 2000 to 30,695 in 2024.

## Act 5: The Mechanics

### Chapter 20: Organizational Mechanics
Within-firm exploration, exploitation, and inter-firm knowledge flows. 11 of 20 major filers keep exploration below 5%. Balanced firms produce blockbusters at 2.3x the rate of specialists.

### Chapter 21: Inventor Mechanics
