text-muted-foreground">Executive Summary</h2><p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">The trajectory of AI patenting reflects a broader transformation in the structure of US patenting, one in which a single methodological breakthrough -- the deep learning revolution of the early 2010s -- reshaped inventive activity across virtually every sector of the economy. What began as a niche area of computing has become a focal point of corporate R&amp;D strategy, with a handful of resource-rich firms building portfolios that increasingly bridge healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications. The widening gap in inventor team sizes between AI and non-AI patents, combined with the geographic concentration of activity in California, suggests that AI innovation is becoming both more collaborative and more spatially clustered than the patent system as a whole -- a pattern that carries significant implications for the distribution of technological capability examined further in the company-level analysis of <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/org-composition/">Assignee Composition</a>.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/agricultural-technology/">agricultural technology</a> and the transformation of food production through precision agriculture, this chapter turns to artificial intelligence, the largest technology domain by patent volume in this study and one whose cross-domain reach extends into virtually every other field examined in ACT 6.</p><p>Artificial intelligence has evolved from a specialized academic pursuit to one of the most active domains in the United States patent system.

The emergence of non-traditional technology firms such as Capital One signals the expanding application of AI beyond core technology sectors, while the convergence of multiple firms at the top suggests intensifying competitive dynamics in AI capabilities.</p></div></aside><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="top-inventors" data-section-label="Top Inventors"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">Top Inventors</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><figure id="fig-ai-patents-top-inventors" aria-labelledby="fig-ai-patents-top-inventors-heading" aria-describedby="fig-ai-patents-top-inventors-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto  "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-ai-patents-top-inventors-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">A Small Cohort of Prolific Inventors Accounts for a Disproportionate Share of AI Patent Output</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Primary inventors ranked by total AI-related patent count from 1976 to 2025, illustrating the skewed distribution of individual output.</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total AI-related patent count from 1976 to 2025, illustrating the skewed distribution of individual output.</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: A Small Cohort of Prolific Inventors Accounts for a Disproportionate Share of AI Patent Output" style="height:1400px;min-height:250px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total AI-related patents, 1976-2025.

A patent is classified as AI-related if any of its CPC codes fall within these categories. Subfield classifications are based on more specific CPC group codes within G06N. AI patenting strategies present patent counts per AI sub-area for the top 20 assignees. AI as GPT measures co-occurrence of AI CPC codes with non-AI CPC sections (Section G excluded since it contains AI classifications). Note: the AI domain overlaps with two other Deep Dive domains — quantum computing patents (G06N10) fall within the broader G06N prefix, and autonomous vehicle scene-understanding patents (G06V20/56) fall within G06V. Patents in these overlapping codes are counted in both domains.</div></div><nav aria-label="Chapter navigation" class="mt-16 flex items-stretch gap-4"><a class="flex flex-1 items-center gap-3 rounded-lg border p-4 hover:bg-accent transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary" href="/patentworld/chapters/agricultural-technology/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-left h-5 w-5 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m15 18-6-6 6-6"></path></svg><div class="text-right flex-1"><div class="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Previous</div><div class="text-sm font-medium">Agricultural Technology</div></div></a><a class="flex flex-1 items-center gap-3 rounded-lg border p-4 hover:bg-accent transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary" href="/patentworld/chapters/autonomous-vehicles/"><div class="flex-1"><div class="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Next</div><div class="text-sm font-medium">Autonomous Vehicles &amp; ADAS</div></div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-right h-5 w-5 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m9 18 6-6-6-6"></path></svg></a></nav></div></article><p class="mt-12 border-t pt-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground">Data coverage: January 1976 through September 2025.
