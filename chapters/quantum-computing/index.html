For decades the field remained largely theoretical, but the 2010s brought a marked shift toward practical hardware implementations. The patent record captures the transition: early filings focused on physical realizations and quantum algorithms, while recent activity is dominated by physical realizations -- superconducting circuits, trapped-ion systems, and photonic architectures -- alongside a growing body of work on quantum error correction. Google&#x27;s 2019 quantum supremacy demonstration accelerated both corporate investment and patenting activity. Today, a small number of major technology firms are competing to build fault-tolerant quantum computers, and their patent strategies reveal divergent bets on competing hardware approaches. Although quantum computing patents remain a small fraction of total patent activity, their rapid growth trajectory and cross-domain reach suggest a technology approaching broader industrial relevance, with implications explored further in the organizational analysis of <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/org-composition/">Assignee Composition</a>.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/green-innovation/">green innovation</a> and the patent system&#x27;s response to climate technology across energy, transport, and industrial production, this chapter turns to quantum computing, a domain at the opposite end of the maturity spectrum — small in volume but growing rapidly as hardware implementations move from theory to engineering.</p><p>Quantum computing represents one of the most technically demanding frontiers in computing.
