Patent grant concentration by assignee remains below conventional thresholds across all technology sectors even as digital fields dominate output. Technology diversity has contracted, S-curve analysis reveals fields at different lifecycle stages, and field-specific metrics such as citation half-lives and examination friction vary substantially across domains. Quality indicators including claim complexity and self-citation patterns round out the field-level picture.</p></aside><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="a-design-versus-utility-patents" data-section-label="A — Design versus Utility Patents"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">A — Design versus Utility Patents</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>The stacked area charts throughout this report reveal that design patents constitute the principal secondary category after utility patents.

Growth rates compare patent counts in 2000-2010 to 2015-2025 for CPC classes with at least 100 patents in each period. The diversity index is computed as 1 minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of CPC section concentration. S-curve parameters are fitted using logistic regression on cumulative patent counts per CPC section (1976-2025). Assignee concentration (HHI) is computed within each CPC section by assignee patent share in 5-year windows. Citation lag uses median lag in years between cited and citing patent grant dates. Technology half-life is computed as the time until 50% of cumulative forward citations are received. Self-citation rates are computed as the fraction of backward citations directed to patents held by the same assignee.</div></div><nav aria-label="Chapter navigation" class="mt-16 flex items-stretch gap-4"><a class="flex flex-1 items-center gap-3 rounded-lg border p-4 hover:bg-accent transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-patent-quality/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-left h-5 w-5 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m15 18-6-6 6-6"></path></svg><div class="text-right flex-1"><div class="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Previous</div><div class="text-sm font-medium">Patent Quality</div></div></a><a class="flex flex-1 items-center gap-3 rounded-lg border p-4 hover:bg-accent transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-convergence/"><div class="flex-1"><div class="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Next</div><div class="text-sm font-medium">Convergence</div></div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-chevron-right h-5 w-5 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m9 18 6-6-6-6"></path></svg></a></nav></div></article><p class="mt-12 border-t pt-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground">Data coverage: January 1976 through September 2025.
