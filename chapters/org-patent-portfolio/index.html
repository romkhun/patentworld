Shannon entropy measurements show that most leading firms have steadily diversified, with Mitsubishi Electric reaching entropy of 7.1 across 287 CPC subclasses. Corporate technology portfolios confirm that the most persistent leaders maintain broad CPC coverage, while Jensen-Shannon divergence analysis detects 51 technology pivots across 20 companies, which can precede strategic shifts that later become publicly visible.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>This chapter examines four complementary perspectives on how firms manage their patent portfolios: competitive proximity mapping reveals which firms occupy similar technology space, Shannon entropy tracks portfolio diversification over time, stacked CPC distributions illustrate how the largest filers distribute innovation across technology domains, and Jensen-Shannon divergence detects strategic pivots in portfolio composition. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive view of corporate technology positioning and portfolio evolution.</p></section><aside aria-label="Key insight" class="fade-in-section my-8 flex gap-3 rounded-lg border border-amber-500/30 bg-amber-50/50 p-4 dark:bg-amber-950/20 "><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-lightbulb mt-0.5 h-5 w-5 shrink-0 text-amber-500" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M15 14c.2-1 .7-1.7 1.5-2.5 1-.9 1.5-2.2 1.5-3.5A6 6 0 0 0 6 8c0 1 .2 2.2 1.5 3.5.7.7 1.3 1.5 1.5 2.5"></path><path d="M9 18h6"></path><path d="M10 22h4"></path></svg><div class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/90"><p>Patent portfolio structure reveals corporate strategy in ways that aggregate counts cannot.

Portfolio diversification tracks Shannon entropy across CPC subclasses per period for the top 50 filers. Corporate technology portfolios use CPC section-level classification for the late period (2001-2025). Technology pivot detection uses Jensen-Shannon divergence between consecutive 3-year windows of CPC subclass distributions; a pivot is flagged when JSD exceeds the 95th percentile of that company&#x27;s own JSD distribution, yielding 51 detected pivots across 20 companies.
