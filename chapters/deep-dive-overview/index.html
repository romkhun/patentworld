Higher entropy indicates greater diversity across subfields. A domain with patents evenly split across 8 subfields would have H ≈ 3.0.</dd></div><div><dt class="font-semibold">Technology Velocity (Entry Cohort Productivity)</dt><dd class="text-muted-foreground mt-1">Average annual patents per assignee, computed by entry-decade cohort.

Higher velocity among later cohorts suggests that open-source diffusion or lower barriers to entry enable faster innovation.</dd></div><div><dt class="font-semibold">International Share</dt><dd class="text-muted-foreground mt-1">The percentage of domain patents whose primary inventor is located outside the United States.
