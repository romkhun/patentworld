The patent record reveals not merely growth in volume but a structural transformation: early cryptographic methods have been surpassed by network security, which now constitutes the largest subfield, alongside rapid growth in authentication and data protection, each responding to distinct threat vectors. The organizational landscape is shaped by the same concentration dynamics observed in <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/ai-patents/">artificial intelligence</a>, with a handful of resource-rich firms building expansive patent portfolios that serve both defensive and strategic purposes. Landmark events -- the Snowden disclosures of 2013, the WannaCry ransomware campaign of 2017, and the SolarWinds supply-chain compromise of 2020 -- appear as inflection points in the data, each triggering measurable surges in patenting activity that reflect the broader pattern of threat-driven innovation documented throughout the <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-patent-fields/">Patent Fields</a> chapter.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/blockchain/">blockchain</a> and the relationship between speculative market cycles and patent filing behavior, this chapter turns to cybersecurity, a domain whose growth trajectory is shaped by escalating digital threats and regulatory mandates.</p><p>As the digital economy has expanded, so too has the attack surface that threatens it.

A patent is classified as cybersecurity-related if any of its CPC codes fall within these categories. Subfield classifications are based on more specific CPC group codes that distinguish cryptography, authentication and access control, network security, data protection, and system security. Strategy analysis shows patent counts per cybersecurity sub-area for the top organizations. Cross-domain diffusion measures co-occurrence of cybersecurity CPC codes with other CPC sections. Note: blockchain patents using H04L9/0643 (distributed ledger technology) overlap with the cybersecurity domain&#x27;s H04L9 cryptographic mechanisms filter and are counted in both domains.
