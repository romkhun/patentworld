The top five states account for 46% of all US patent grants, and each has developed distinctive technology specialization profiles shaped by regional industry, universities, and talent pools. City-level analysis reveals even more extreme innovation concentration, with San Jose, San Diego, and Austin leading all US cities. California&#x27;s patent output has diverged sharply from other states since the 1990s, reaching 4.0x Texas by 2024.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Innovation activity is not evenly distributed across geographic space. Within the United States, a small number of states and metropolitan areas account for the majority of patent output. This chapter examines the domestic geography of innovation at both the state and city levels, including cumulative rankings, technology specialization profiles, temporal trends, and regional quality metrics.</p><p>The concentration documented here reflects the co-location of technology firms, research universities, and venture capital in a small number of self-reinforcing innovation ecosystems. These patterns of geographic clustering have strengthened rather than diminished over the digital era, suggesting that agglomeration forces continue to shape the geography of innovation despite advances in remote collaboration.</p></section><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="state-and-regional-patterns" data-section-label="State and Regional Patterns"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">State and Regional Patterns</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Within the United States, patent activity concentrates in a small number of states and metropolitan areas.
