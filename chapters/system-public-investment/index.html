Research in the academic literature suggests that government-funded patents tend to be associated with higher citation impact (Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Li, &amp; Sampat, 2019; Jaffe &amp; Lerner, 2001; Mowery, Nelson, Sampat, &amp; Ziedonis, 2001; Sampat, 2006), supporting the role of public R&amp;D investment in generating foundational knowledge.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>A key dimension of the patent landscape concerns the role of government funding in generating patented inventions.
