The primary assignee (sequence 0) is used to avoid double-counting patents with multiple assignees. Rankings are based on cumulative utility patent grants, 1976-2025. Concentration ratios are computed as the fraction of all corporate patents held by the top 10, 50, and 100 organizations per 5-year period. Design patent rankings use total design patents granted across all years. Corporate mortality tracks presence in the top 50 patent filers per decade (1976-2025). Organization names are cleaned and standardized for display purposes. Blockbuster patents are defined as the top 1% by forward citations within 5 years, normalized within filing year and CPC section cohort.
