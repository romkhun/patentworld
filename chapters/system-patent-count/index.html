What began as an annual output of 66,000 grants per year (average, 1976–1979) had escalated to 374,000 by 2024, an expansion driven overwhelmingly by utility patents and coinciding with successive waves of technological transformation from personal computing through artificial intelligence. This growth has not come without friction: prolonged examination backlogs during the late 2000s imposed years of legal uncertainty on applicants at precisely the moment when computing and telecommunications innovation was accelerating most rapidly. Average (mean) grant pendency peaked at 3.8 years in 2010 (measured by grant year) before the USPTO undertook initiatives to reduce processing times.</p></aside><div class="fade-in-section my-8 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-4 "><div class="rounded-lg border-l-2 border border-l-chart-1 bg-card p-5"><div class="font-serif text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight">9.36M</div><div class="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">Total Patents (All Types)</div></div><div class="rounded-lg border-l-2 border border-l-chart-1 bg-card p-5"><div class="font-serif text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight">50</div><div class="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">Years (1976-2025)</div></div><div class="rounded-lg border-l-2 border border-l-chart-1 bg-card p-5"><div class="font-serif text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight">2019</div><div class="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">Peak Year</div></div><div class="rounded-lg border-l-2 border border-l-chart-1 bg-card p-5"><div class="font-serif text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight">393K</div><div class="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">Grants in 2019 (all types)</div></div></div><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Between 1976 and 2025, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted<!-- --> <span class="font-semibold text-foreground bg-primary/5 px-1 rounded border-b-2 border-primary/20">9.36M</span> patents.
