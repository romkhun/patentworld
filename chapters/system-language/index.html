Perhaps most notable is the overall rise in thematic diversity at the individual patent level: inventions that blend language from traditionally separate fields have become markedly more common, suggesting that the boundaries between technology domains documented in <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-patent-quality/">Patent Quality</a> and <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-patent-fields/">Patent Fields</a> are growing more permeable over time.
