The absolute number of first-time inventors peaked at 140,490 in 2019, but their share of total patent activity has declined from 71% to 26%, indicating the system increasingly favors experienced, repeat filers. A small elite of serial inventors produces a disproportionate share of all output, while career survival curves reveal that most inventors patent only once. For those who persist, productivity rises steeply in early career years before plateauing, and a subset of &quot;comeback&quot; inventors return after extended absences, often with new employers and new technology fields.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Understanding who invents -- and who persists as an inventor -- is central to understanding the innovation system. This chapter brings together several dimensions of inventor experience: the flow of new entrants, the dominance of serial inventors, career survival and productivity trajectories, and the phenomenon of inventor comebacks after extended absences. Together, these patterns reveal a system in which a small, persistent core of repeat inventors accounts for an outsized share of patent output, even as new talent continues to enter the system each year.</p></section><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="new-entrants" data-section-label="New Entrants"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">New Entrants</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Beyond the aggregate growth in patenting, tracking both the absolute number of first-time filers and their share of total patent activity reveals whether the system continues to attract new talent or is increasingly dominated by repeat inventors.</p></section><figure id="fig-inventors-first-time-entries" aria-labelledby="fig-inventors-first-time-entries-heading" aria-describedby="fig-inventors-first-time-entries-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto  "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-inventors-first-time-entries-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">Annual First-Time Inventor Entries Rose from 35,126 in 1979 to a Peak of 140,490 in 2019</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Number of inventors filing their first US patent each year, measuring new entrant inflow, 1976-2025</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Number of inventors filing their first US patent each year, measuring new entrant inflow, 1976-2025</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: Annual First-Time Inventor Entries Rose from 35,126 in 1979 to a Peak of 140,490 in 2019" style="height:600px;min-height:250px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->The figure displays the number of inventors filing their first US patent in each year.
