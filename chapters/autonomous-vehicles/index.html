What began with Google&#x27;s self-driving project in 2009 has grown into a global competition involving automakers, technology companies, sensor manufacturers, and ride-hailing platforms, each building patent portfolios that reflect fundamentally different technical approaches. The debate between lidar-based and camera-based perception systems -- exemplified by Waymo and Tesla respectively -- is evident in the patent data, as is the growing convergence of <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/ai-patents/">artificial intelligence</a>, advanced sensor technology, and automotive engineering. The 2016 Tesla Autopilot crash and subsequent safety debates have not slowed patent activity but have shifted its composition, with an increasing share of filings addressing redundancy, fail-safe mechanisms, and human-machine interaction -- patterns consistent with the broader maturation of the field documented in the <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/system-patent-fields/">Patent Fields</a> chapter.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/ai-patents/">artificial intelligence</a> and its role as a general-purpose technology across the patent system, this chapter turns to autonomous vehicles, a domain where AI-driven perception and decision-making systems constitute the core of inventive activity.</p><p>Autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) represent a convergence of artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and automotive engineering.

Through the 2000s, traditional automakers such as Toyota and GM held the top positions largely unchallenged. The 2010s exhibited rapid convergence as Google/Waymo, Zoox, Amazon, and other technology firms scaled their autonomous driving programs. This intensifying competition is consistent with the characterization of autonomous driving as a technology domain where incumbency in automotive manufacturing does not guarantee leadership -- a pattern that distinguishes AV from most other transportation-related patent categories.</p></div></aside><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="top-inventors" data-section-label="Top Inventors"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">Top Inventors</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><figure id="fig-av-top-inventors" aria-labelledby="fig-av-top-inventors-heading" aria-describedby="fig-av-top-inventors-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto  "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-av-top-inventors-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">A Small Cohort of Prolific Inventors Accounts for a Disproportionate Share of AV Patent Output</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Primary inventors ranked by total AV-related patent count, illustrating the skewed distribution of individual output.</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total AV-related patent count, illustrating the skewed distribution of individual output.</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: A Small Cohort of Prolific Inventors Accounts for a Disproportionate Share of AV Patent Output" style="height:1400px;min-height:250px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total AV-related patents, 1976-2025.

A patent is classified as AV-related if any of its CPC codes fall within these categories. Subfield classifications are based on more specific CPC group codes: Autonomous Driving Systems (B60W60) encompasses core self-driving architectures, Vehicle Control (G05D1) covers steering, braking, and acceleration algorithms, Navigation &amp; Path Planning (G05D1/00, G05D1/02) addresses route optimization and decision-making, and Scene Understanding (G06V20/56) captures computer vision applied to driving environments. AV patenting strategies show patent counts per AV sub-area for the top assignees. The diffusion analysis measures co-occurrence of AV CPC codes with other CPC sections.
