When firms do enter new domains, exploration scores decay from 1.0 to below 0.1 within 5 years -- yet balanced firms that maintain ambidexterity produce blockbuster patents at 2.3 times the rate of specialized firms.

The first half applies March&#x27;s (1991) exploration/exploitation framework to patent data, revealing how firms balance the search for new technology domains against the deepening of established ones -- and how this balance shapes innovation outcomes including blockbuster patent production and quality concentration. The second half maps the inter-firm knowledge flows that connect organizations through co-patenting relationships and directed citation networks, exposing the structural dependencies that shape the corporate innovation landscape.</p></section><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="a-within-firm-exploration-and-exploitation" data-section-label="A — Within-Firm Exploration and Exploitation"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">A — Within-Firm Exploration and Exploitation</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="exploration-and-exploitation" data-section-label="Exploration and Exploitation"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">Exploration and Exploitation</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>The exploration/exploitation framework (March, 1991) provides a lens for examining whether firms are entering new technology domains (exploration) or deepening established ones (exploitation). Each patent from a top-50 assignee is scored on three equally weighted indicators: (1) technology newness (1 if the firm has no prior patents in the patent&#x27;s CPC subclass within the preceding 5 years, 0 otherwise), (2) citation newness (the share of backward citations pointing to CPC subclasses outside the firm&#x27;s existing portfolio), and (3) external knowledge sourcing (1 minus the self-citation rate, i.e., the share of backward citations directed to other assignees&#x27; patents). The composite exploration score is the unweighted arithmetic mean of these three indicators, yielding a value on a 0-1 scale where higher values indicate more exploratory behavior.</p></section><div class="mb-6"><div class="text-sm font-medium mb-2">Select a company:</div><div class="relative w-full max-w-sm"><button type="button" role="combobox" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-controls="pw-company-selector-listbox" class="flex w-full items-center justify-between rounded-lg border bg-card px-4 py-2.5 text-sm font-medium text-foreground shadow-sm hover:bg-accent/50 transition-colors"><span class="truncate">IBM</span><svg class="ml-2 h-4 w-4 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground transition-transform " fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7"></path></svg></button></div></div><figure id="fig-mech-org-exploration-score" aria-labelledby="fig-mech-org-exploration-score-heading" aria-describedby="fig-mech-org-exploration-score-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto -mx-4 lg:-mx-8 !max-w-none "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-mech-org-exploration-score-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">IBM&#x27;s Exploration Score Averages 0.15 Across 49 Years of Patenting</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Composite exploration score and its three components (technology newness, citation newness, external sourcing) for the selected firm by year.</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Composite exploration score and its three components (technology newness, citation newness, external sourcing) for the selected firm by year.</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: IBM&#x27;s Exploration Score Averages 0.15 Across 49 Years of Patenting" style="height:350px;min-height:250px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->Mean exploration score and its three component indicators for IBM by year.

The composite score averages the three indicators. Exploration trajectories track the share of exploratory patents per year for the 20 largest filers. Exploration decay tracks mean exploration scores by years since entry into a new CPC subclass. The ambidexterity index equals 1 minus the absolute difference between exploration and exploitation shares; it ranges from 0 (pure specialist) to 1 (perfect balance). Blockbuster rate measures the share of patents in the top 1% of their year by CPC section cohort. Within-firm quality Gini applies the Gini coefficient to 5-year forward citations within each firm&#x27;s annual patent cohort. Co-patenting identifies patents with 2+ distinct organizational assignees. Corporate citation flows aggregate all citations between pairs of the top 30 assignees per decade. Technology leadership ranks firms by total citations received within each CPC section per time window. Exploration-exploitation trajectories plot the cosine distance from each firm&#x27;s prior CPC centroid (exploration index) against the self-citation rate across 5-year windows.
