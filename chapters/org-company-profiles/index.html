The interactive dashboards reveal that no single metric captures the complexity of corporate innovation -- volume, quality, breadth, strategy, and speed each contribute to a firm&#x27;s strategic fingerprint. But organizations do not invent; individuals do. The patterns documented across Chapters 8–12 -- rising concentration, portfolio diversification, and quality dispersion -- ultimately reflect the aggregate contributions of the inventors who work within these firms.

Annual patent counts, CPC distributions, median 5-year forward citations, average team sizes, inventor counts, and CPC subclass breadth are computed for each year in which the company has at least one patent grant. Citation data is limited to patents granted through 2020 to allow for 5-year citation accumulation. Strategy profiles normalize 8 innovation dimensions to a 0-100 scale across the top 30 assignees. Grant lag measures median days from application filing to patent grant. Fan charts show citation percentile distributions (P10, P25, median, P75, P90) for firms with at least 10 patents per grant year. Blockbuster rate measures the share of patents in the top 1% of their year x CPC section cohort. Technology evolution uses CPC section-level classification aggregated by 5-year period.
