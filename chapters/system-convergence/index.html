Yet the boundaries between technology fields are not fixed. As digital technology has become pervasive, inventions increasingly span multiple CPC sections, and once-separate domains have become deeply intertwined.</p><p>This chapter examines cross-domain convergence from two complementary perspectives: the aggregate trend toward multi-section patents, which captures the overall rate of convergence, and the specific pairs of CPC sections that drive that convergence, which reveals where technology boundaries are most permeable. Together, these measures demonstrate that the patent system is no longer a collection of independent silos but an increasingly interconnected network of technological activity.</p></section><figure id="fig-cross-field-convergence-matrix" aria-labelledby="fig-cross-field-convergence-matrix-heading" aria-describedby="fig-cross-field-convergence-matrix-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto  "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-cross-field-convergence-matrix-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">The G-H (Physics-Electricity) Convergence Pair Rose from 12.5% to 37.5% of All Cross-Section Patents Between 1976-1995 and 2011-2025</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Percentage of multi-section patents spanning each CPC section pair by era, measuring how technology boundaries have become more permeable.</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Percentage of multi-section patents spanning each CPC section pair by era, measuring how technology boundaries have become more permeable.</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: The G-H (Physics-Electricity) Convergence Pair Rose from 12.5% to 37.5% of All Cross-Section Patents Between 1976-1995 and 2011-2025" style="min-height:700px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->The figure displays the percentage of multi-section patents that span each pair of CPC sections, by era.
