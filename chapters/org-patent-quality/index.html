Blockbuster rate measures the share of patents in the top 1% of their year x CPC section cohort. Dud rate measures the share of patents receiving zero 5-year forward citations. Self-citation rate measures the fraction of backward citations directed to the same assignee. Citation half-life uses patents granted before 2010 to ensure at least 15 years of citation accumulation. The quality scatter uses the most recent complete decade (2010-2019) to ensure complete citation windows.
