The data are consistent with these legal shifts producing observable changes in patent filing patterns within one to two years of enactment: the already-rising trend in applications around the 1998 State Street decision, pendency declines after AIA-era reforms, and a potential moderation in software-related patenting following the 2014 Alice eligibility restriction.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>The patent system operates within a dynamic legal and institutional context.

CLS Bank International (2014):</strong> The Court held that abstract ideas implemented on generic computers are not patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101, substantially narrowing patent eligibility.
