The trajectory of agricultural technology patents reveals a sector undergoing a fundamental transformation -- from the mechanization-era patents for soil working and planting equipment that dominated the twentieth century to the precision agriculture, biotechnology, and data-driven farming technologies that define the twenty-first. The adoption of genetically modified crops beginning in 1996 marked a substantial structural change, shifting the center of agricultural innovation from mechanical engineering to molecular biology and plant science. Today, the convergence of GPS, remote sensing, machine learning, and genomics is creating a new generation of agricultural patents that bridge traditional farming with digital technology. The organizational landscape is led by Pioneer Hi-Bred and Monsanto in seed and plant science, alongside Deere &amp; Company in agricultural equipment, with patent strategies explored further in <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/org-composition/">Assignee Composition</a>.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/3d-printing/">3D printing</a> and the role of patent expirations in democratizing manufacturing technology, this chapter turns to agricultural technology, a domain where biological and digital innovations are reshaping food production through precision agriculture and biotechnology.</p><p>Agriculture is one of the oldest areas of innovation in the United States patent system.

Pioneer Hi-Bred and Monsanto have maintained dominant positions through sustained investment in seed science and plant breeding, while Deere &amp; Company has held a consistent top-tier position through investment in both mechanical and digital agricultural technologies. The merger activity among seed and chemical companies -- including Dow-DuPont, ChemChina-Syngenta, and Bayer-Monsanto -- has reshaped the competitive landscape, concentrating patent portfolios among fewer but larger entities. While some technology companies appear in the broader rankings, their agricultural patent volumes remain modest compared to the dominant agribusiness firms.</p></div></aside><div class="relative my-12 flex items-center scroll-mt-20" id="top-inventors" data-section-label="Top Inventors"><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div><span class="mx-4 text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-widest text-muted-foreground">Top Inventors</span><div class="flex-grow border-t border-border"></div></div><figure id="fig-agtech-top-inventors" aria-labelledby="fig-agtech-top-inventors-heading" aria-describedby="fig-agtech-top-inventors-caption" class="fade-in-section relative my-16 rounded-lg border bg-card p-4 sm:p-6 overflow-hidden max-w-[960px] mx-auto  "><div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 h-[2px]" style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(var(--chart-1)), hsl(var(--chart-5)))" aria-hidden="true"></div><h3 id="fig-agtech-top-inventors-heading" class="mb-1 font-sans text-base font-bold leading-snug tracking-tight text-foreground/90">The Most Prolific Agricultural Inventors Are Concentrated in Plant Breeding, Equipment Design, and Precision Agriculture</h3><p class="mb-4 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">Primary inventors ranked by total agricultural technology patent count, illustrating the distribution of individual inventive output.</p><noscript><p class="my-4 rounded border border-muted p-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">This visualization requires JavaScript.<!-- --> <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total agricultural technology patent count, illustrating the distribution of individual inventive output.</p></noscript><div class="chart-container-inner relative flex items-end justify-center overflow-hidden" role="img" aria-label="Loading chart: The Most Prolific Agricultural Inventors Are Concentrated in Plant Breeding, Equipment Design, and Precision Agriculture" style="height:1400px;min-height:250px"><div class="absolute inset-0 flex items-end px-12 pb-10 pt-8" aria-hidden="true"><div class="absolute left-10 top-6 bottom-8 w-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="absolute left-10 right-6 bottom-8 h-px bg-muted-foreground/15"></div><div class="flex items-end gap-[3%] w-full h-full"><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:35%;animation-delay:0ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:45%;animation-delay:80ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:50%;animation-delay:160ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:60%;animation-delay:240ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:72%;animation-delay:320ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:68%;animation-delay:400ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:80%;animation-delay:480ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:75%;animation-delay:560ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:65%;animation-delay:640ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:55%;animation-delay:720ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:40%;animation-delay:800ms"></div><div class="flex-1 rounded-t bg-muted/60 animate-pulse" style="height:30%;animation-delay:880ms"></div></div></div><p class="relative z-10 mb-4 text-xs text-muted-foreground/50">Loading visualization…</p><noscript><p class="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center text-sm text-muted-foreground px-8 text-center">This interactive chart requires JavaScript. <!-- -->Primary inventors ranked by total agricultural technology patents.
