The trajectory of digital health patenting has been shaped by two significant developments: the 2009 HITECH Act, which mandated electronic health record adoption and coincided with a wave of health IT investment, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which compressed years of telemedicine adoption into months. The organizational landscape is dominated by medical device firms such as Philips, Medtronic, and Intuitive Surgical, alongside technology companies including IBM and Samsung -- yet the growing role of AI in clinical decision support is drawing even more technology firms into the domain, a convergence explored further in the chapter on <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/ai-patents/">Artificial Intelligence</a>. Surgical robotics represents an active frontier, where Intuitive Surgical&#x27;s da Vinci system has demonstrated how patent-protected platforms can reshape surgical disciplines.</p></aside><section class="fade-in-section prose-custom my-8 max-w-prose text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground/90 "><p>Having examined <a class="underline decoration-muted-foreground/50 hover:decoration-foreground transition-colors" href="/patentworld/chapters/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> and the escalating arms race between digital threats and defensive innovation, this chapter turns to digital health, a domain where data security considerations increasingly intersect with patient monitoring and clinical decision support.</p><p>Digital health bridges the worlds of medicine and computing, encompassing a broad range of technologies designed to capture, analyze, and act upon health-related data.

Note: diagnostic imaging codes A61B6 and A61B8 are not included in the filter, as these primarily cover traditional radiology equipment rather than digital health applications. Subfield classifications are based on specific CPC group codes within these categories. A patent is classified as digital health if any of its CPC codes fall within these classifications. Team comparison data compare average inventor counts for digital health versus non-digital-health utility patents. Strategy data show patent counts per subfield for the top assignees. Cross-domain diffusion measures co-occurrence of digital health CPC codes with other CPC sections.
