Annual grants increased from approximately 70,000 in the late 1970s to over 350,000 per year by the 2020s, representing a five-fold increase over five decades."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which company holds the most US patents?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"IBM has been the most prolific US patent filer for most of the past three decades, consistently ranking first or second in annual grants. Samsung, Canon, Intel, and TSMC are among the other top patent holders. The top 100 firms collectively hold approximately 30% of all US patents."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does it take to obtain a US patent?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The average time from application filing to patent grant (grant lag or pendency) peaked above 3 years in the early 2010s before declining to approximately 2 years by the 2020s. Grant lag varies substantially by technology area, with software and biotechnology patents typically taking longer than mechanical inventions."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the fastest-growing patent technology areas?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Computing and electronics have grown from approximately 12–15% of all US patents in 1976 to approximately 33–40% by 2025. Within this broad category, artificial intelligence, semiconductor design, and wireless communications have exhibited the strongest growth rates in recent years."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is artificial intelligence patenting increasing?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"AI patent filings grew approximately six-fold during the deep learning era (2012-2025). The acceleration began after breakthroughs in deep neural networks around 2012 and intensified further with the emergence of generative AI technologies after 2020."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the gender gap in US patenting?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Women represent approximately 15% of all US patent inventors as of the most recent data. While the share has grown from under 5% in the 1970s, the gap remains substantial across virtually all technology sectors, with the narrowest gaps in chemistry and biotechnology."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which countries file the most US patents?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The United States accounts for the largest share of US patent grants, followed by Japan, South Korea, China, and Germany. Foreign-origin patents now constitute over 50% of all US grants, reflecting the global nature of innovation. China has been the fastest-growing source of US patents since 2010."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How has patent quality changed over time?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Median forward citations (a common proxy for patent quality) declined approximately 40% as patent volume increased substantially. However, originality and generality scores have remained relatively stable, and the patents in the upper tail of the citation distribution continue to receive high citation counts, suggesting that the average has declined while top-quality innovation persists."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What was the impact of the America Invents Act?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011 was the most significant US patent reform in decades. It shifted the US from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system, created new post-grant review proceedings, and expanded prior art definitions. Inter partes review has since become a major mechanism for challenging patent validity."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How many patents does the average inventor hold?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The majority of patent inventors hold only one or two patents. The median inventor has approximately 2 patents, while the mean is higher due to prolific inventors. A small fraction of inventors (less than 1%) hold more than 50 patents, and these prolific inventors account for a disproportionate share of total patent output."}}]}7:T158c,[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebSite","name":"PatentWorld","description":"An interactive exploration of 9.36 million US patents spanning 50 years of global
