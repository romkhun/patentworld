## Methodology

Raw data downloaded as TSV files from PatentsView bulk data downloads, processed using DuckDB analytical SQL database and Polars (Python). Key processing: joining patent records with inventor/assignee/location/classification data, aggregating by year/technology/geography/organization, computing derived metrics (citation counts, team sizes, concentration ratios, diversity indices).

## Technology

Built with Next.js 14, Recharts, Tailwind CSS. All data pre-computed and served as static JSON. Static site export with dark/light theme support.
