> An interactive data exploration of 9.36 million US patents spanning 50 years of global innovation (1976-2025). Data from PatentsView / USPTO.

## Chapter 1: The Innovation Landscape
50 years of global invention in 9.36 million US patents. This chapter examines how the pace and nature of patenting has changed since 1976. Key findings:
- Annual patent grants grew from ~70,000 in 1976 to over 350,000 by 2025
- The growth rate accelerated dramatically in the 1990s with the digital revolution
- Patent activity is a leading indicator of technological change and economic competitiveness

## Chapter 2: The Technology Revolution
The shifting frontiers of technology as revealed through patent classification data. Key findings:
- Electricity (CPC Section H) and Physics (Section G) have grown from minority shares to dominate patenting, reflecting the digital transformation
- Chemistry and mechanical engineering patents grew in absolute terms but declined as shares of total activity
- WIPO sector analysis reveals electrical engineering overtaking all other sectors since the 1990s
- The rise of software, semiconductors, telecommunications, and digital computing reshaped the technology landscape

## Chapter 3: Who Innovates?
The organizations driving patent activity. Key findings:
- IBM held the #1 position for decades; Samsung, Canon, and other Asian firms now rival US incumbents
- Corporate patenting dominates, but government-funded research (via Bayh-Dole Act) and university patenting grew significantly after 1980
- Market concentration in patenting has both increased (top firms patent more) and decreased (more diverse set of patentees)
- The share of patents assigned to foreign organizations has grown substantially

## Chapter 4: The Inventors
The people behind the patents. Key findings:
- Average team size has grown from ~1.8 inventors per patent in the 1970s to over 3.0 by the 2020s, reflecting increasing specialization
- Women's share of patenting has grown but remains below 15%, with significant variation across technology fields
- The most prolific individual inventors have produced thousands of patents each
- Star inventors have outsized impact on citation metrics and knowledge creation

## Chapter 5: The Geography of Innovation
Where ideas are born. Key findings:
- California alone accounts for more patents than the bottom 30 US states combined
- Silicon Valley, the Northeast corridor, and the Research Triangle are dominant innovation hubs
- International origins have shifted dramatically: Japan dominated foreign patenting in the 1980s-90s, while South Korea, China, and Taiwan have surged since 2000
- Geographic concentration of innovation has implications for regional economic development

## Chapter 6: Collaboration Networks
The web of co-invention and co-patenting. Key findings:
- Firm-to-firm co-patenting networks reveal industry clusters and strategic alliances
- International inventor migration flows show talent moving primarily from Asia to the US
- Co-inventor networks have become denser over time, with shorter average path lengths between inventors

## Chapter 7: The Knowledge Network
How ideas build on ideas through patent citations. Key findings:
- Average citations per patent have increased over time, reflecting denser knowledge networks
- Cross-technology knowledge flows reveal which fields build on which others
- Government-funded patents (identified via government interest statements) receive more citations on average
- The citation network reveals the cumulative nature of technological progress

## Chapter 8: Innovation Dynamics
The tempo and trajectory of invention. Key findings:
- Grant lag (application to grant) has varied from ~2 years to over 3.5 years, reflecting patent office backlogs
- Cross-domain innovation (patents spanning multiple CPC sections) has grown, reflecting technological convergence
- International collaboration in patenting grew from under 5% to over 10% of all patents
- Innovation velocity (year-over-year growth) is highly correlated across sectors, suggesting macroeconomic drivers dominate

## Chapter 9: Patent Quality
Measuring the value and impact of inventions. Key findings:
- Forward citation counts, originality indices, and generality scores provide complementary measures of patent quality
- Quality distributions are highly skewed: a small fraction of patents receive the majority of citations
- Quality metrics vary significantly across technology sectors and over time
- Patent quality indicators help distinguish breakthrough inventions from incremental improvements

## Chapter 10: Patent Law & Policy
The rules that shape innovation, with academic research from top economics and management journals. Key events:
- Bayh-Dole Act (1980): Enabled university patenting of federally funded inventions
- Federal Circuit (1982): Unified and strengthened patent rights
- Hatch-Waxman Act (1984): Balanced generic drug entry with pharma patent protection
- TRIPS Agreement (1994): Established global minimum patent standards
- State Street Bank (1998): Enabled business method patents
- American Inventors Protection Act (1999): Required 18-month publication
- eBay v. MercExchange (2006): Ended automatic injunctive relief
- KSR v. Teleflex (2007): Broadened obviousness standard
- America Invents Act (2011): First-inventor-to-file, created IPR/PTAB
- Myriad (2013): DNA not patent eligible
- Alice Corp. (2014): Restricted abstract idea patents
- TC Heartland (2017): Restricted patent venue rules

## Chapter 11: Artificial Intelligence
The rise of AI in the patent system. Key findings:
- AI patenting has grown exponentially, especially since 2012 with deep learning breakthroughs
- Machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing are the fastest-growing AI subfields
- Top AI patent holders include IBM, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, and major tech firms
- The generative AI era (2020s) has created new patenting frontiers
