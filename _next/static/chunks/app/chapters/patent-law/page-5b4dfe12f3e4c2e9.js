Shorter half-lives indicate more immediately impactful inventions; longer half-lives suggest foundational work."},"talent flow":{term:"talent flow",definition:"The movement of inventors between organizations, tracked by consecutive patent filings with different assignees. Net talent flow reveals which companies are gaining vs. losing inventive talent."},"k-means clustering":{term:"k-means clustering",definition:"An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into k groups by minimizing within-cluster distances. Used here to classify company innovation trajectories into archetypes."},"radar chart":{term:"radar chart",definition:"A multi-dimensional chart that plots values along multiple axes radiating from a center point. Useful for comparing strategy profiles across several dimensions simultaneously."},"chord diagram":{term:"chord diagram",definition:"A circular visualization showing flows or connections between entities. Arcs represent entities; ribbons connecting them represent directed flows (e.g., citation flows between companies)."},"Sankey diagram":{term:"Sankey diagram",definition:"A flow diagram where the width of links is proportional to the quantity of flow.
