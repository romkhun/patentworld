California's dominance stems partly from its concentration of semiconductor, software, and biotechnology firms rather than any inherent state-level advantage. Without controlling for industry mix and firm characteristics, cross-state comparisons are descriptive."},composition:{title:"Why can't we infer causation from assignee composition trends?",body:"The correlation between foreign assignee growth and various patent metrics — such as citation rates, technology concentration, or filing routes — does not establish a causal relationship. Foreign assignees differ systematically from domestic assignees in firm size, technology specialization, industry composition, and strategic filing behavior. The shift toward foreign-majority patenting coincided with globalization, trade liberalization, and the rise of East Asian R&D investment, all of which independently affect patent outcomes. Without controlling for these confounders, the observed associations between assignee origin and patent characteristics are descriptive."}};function r(e){let{variant:t}=e,i=o[t];return
