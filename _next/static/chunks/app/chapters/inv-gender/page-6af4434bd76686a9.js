Higher citation rates for one country's patents do not imply that its inventors are more productive absent controls for field, firm, and cohort effects."},"top-inventors":{title:"Why can't we infer causation from superstar inventor patterns?",body:"Prolific inventors work at elite firms, in high-citation fields, and with larger teams. Their outsized citation impact may reflect institutional advantages (access to resources, networks, and complementary talent) rather than individual ability alone. Survivorship bias also plays a role: we observe inventors who remained prolific, not those who left patenting."},"serial-new":{title:"Why can't we infer causation from serial vs. new entrant differences?",body:"Serial inventors and new entrants differ systematically in firm affiliation, technology domain, team size, and access to prior art. Higher productivity and citation rates among serial inventors may reflect accumulated human capital, but also survivorship bias (only successful inventors continue patenting), firm-level resources, and network advantages. Without controlling for these factors, the observed differences are descriptive."},domestic:{title:"Why can't we infer causation from state-level differences?",body:"State-level patent differences reflect industry composition, university density, federal lab presence, venture capital availability, and historical agglomeration effects. California's dominance stems partly from its concentration of semiconductor, software, and biotechnology firms rather than any inherent state-level advantage. Without controlling for industry mix and firm characteristics, cross-state comparisons are descriptive."},composition:{title:"Why can't we infer causation from assignee composition trends?",body:"The correlation between foreign assignee growth and various patent metrics — such as citation rates, technology concentration, or filing routes — does not establish a causal relationship. Foreign assignees differ systematically from domestic assignees in firm size, technology specialization, industry composition, and strategic filing behavior. The shift toward foreign-majority patenting coincided with globalization, trade liberalization, and the rise of East Asian R&D investment, all of which independently affect patent outcomes. Without controlling for these confounders, the observed associations between assignee origin and patent characteristics are descriptive."}};function o(e){let{variant:t}=e,n=r[t];return
