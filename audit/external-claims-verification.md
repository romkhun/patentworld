**TECHNOLOGY_CONTEXT: 47/47 verified, 44 MATCH, 3 MINOR NOTES, 0 MISMATCH**

Note on MINOR NOTES: The Bitcoin whitepaper was published October 31, 2008. The site's reference events file uses "2009" which corresponds to the Bitcoin network launch (January 3, 2009), not the whitepaper date. This is a contextual choice (network launch vs. whitepaper), not a factual error. The narrative text in the blockchain chapter says "Bitcoin whitepaper of 2009" which is technically the whitepaper's date being off by ~2 months (it was late 2008).

### Minor Notes (not errors, but worth noting):

1. **Bitcoin whitepaper date (Registry IDs 73, 75, 159):** The site references "2009" in multiple places for the Bitcoin whitepaper. The whitepaper was published October 31, 2008; the Bitcoin network launched January 3, 2009. The reference events file using "2009" likely refers to the network launch, which is a defensible choice, but the blockchain chapter narrative text saying "Bitcoin whitepaper of 2009" is slightly imprecise.

2. **Yamazaki career start (Registry ID 115):** The FAQ states patents span "1980-2025" but Yamazaki's career actually dates from 1969.

3. **GDPR date (Registry ID 142):** The reference events file pairs "WannaCry / GDPR" at year 2017. WannaCry was indeed 2017, but GDPR took effect May 25, 2018 (adopted 2016). This is an approximation for chart annotation purposes.

4. **Private vs. government space funding (Registry ID 168):** The claim that "private-sector investment now exceeds government funding" is slightly overstated; government funding still outweighs private investment overall (~10x), though private investment has grown substantially in specific categories.

### Mismatch (requires correction):

1. **Azoulay et al. journal citation (Registry ID 61):** The paper "Public R&D Investments and Private-sector Patenting" is cited as "Journal of Political Economy 127(4), 1640-1671" but was published in "Review of Economic Studies, 86(1), 117-152." The journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers are all incorrect.
