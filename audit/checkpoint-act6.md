# Checkpoint: Act 6 — Deep Dives (Group 7)

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Chapters:** 12 (3d-printing, agricultural-technology, ai-patents, autonomous-vehicles, biotechnology, blockchain, cybersecurity, digital-health, green-innovation, quantum-computing, semiconductors, space-technology)

## Track A — Data Accuracy
- All 12 domain CPC definitions verified against pipeline SQL
- AV caption CPC codes corrected: (B60W60, G05D1, G06V20/56)
- Blockchain DataNote CPC code corrected: G06Q20/0655
- Growth multiples corrected:
  - AgTech: "nearly quadrupled" → "more than quadrupled" (4.45×)
  - Biotech: "tripled" → "nearly tripled" (2.93×)
- Concentration paradox resolved:
  - Semiconductors: "rising since 2010" (not since 1977), "primary domain" (not "only domain")
  - Quantum: added "and semiconductors (32%)" alongside agricultural technology

## Track C — Methodology
- Cross-domain metrics verified: top-4 concentration, entry velocity, subfield diversity
- Small-sample warnings added to blockchain, quantum, 3d-printing, ai-patents, autonomous-vehicles

## Language & Sensitivity
- "catalyzed" → "coincided with" (3d-printing, space-technology)
- "enabled" → "coincided with" / "associated with" (3d-printing, digital-health)
- FDM expanded on first use
- Partial-year 2025 "(through September)" uniformly disclosed
- CPC wrapped in GlossaryTooltip on eligible pages
- En-dashes standardized for all date ranges
