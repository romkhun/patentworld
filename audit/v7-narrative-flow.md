# PatentWorld v7 Audit -- Narrative Flow Assessment (Phase 2, Section 2.1)

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Auditor:** Claude Opus 4.6 (automated comprehensive audit)
**Scope:** All 34 chapters assessed for narrative flow quality

---

## Method

Each chapter was read in full and assessed for:
1. Logical progression from introduction to conclusion.
2. Smooth transitions between sections.
3. Appropriate use of KeyInsights, SectionDividers, and DataNotes to guide the reader.
4. Consistency between Executive Summary claims and subsequent evidence.

## Assessment Summary

| Act | Chapters | Flow Quality | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------|
| Act 1: The System | 7 | STRONG | Progressive build from volume to quality to fields to convergence to language to law to investment. Each chapter builds on prior context. |
| Act 2: The Organizations | 5 | STRONG | Composition to output to quality to portfolio to profiles. Natural organizational analysis progression. |
| Act 3: The Inventors | 5 | STRONG | Top inventors to specialization to entry patterns to gender to team size. Inventor-centric lens maintained throughout. |
| Act 4: The Geography | 2 | ADEQUATE | Domestic then international. Tight two-chapter structure. Limited cross-referencing between the two. |
| Act 5: The Mechanics | 3 | STRONG | Organization mobility to inventor mobility to geographic flows. Clear mechanistic framing linking organizational, individual, and spatial dimensions. |
| Act 6: Deep Dives | 12 | STRONG | All 12 follow a consistent analytical template. Framework is predictable (in a positive sense) -- readers learn the structure once and can navigate efficiently. |

## Per-Chapter Assessment

All 34 chapters rated ADEQUATE or STRONG. No chapters flagged as WEAK.

**Strongest chapters (exemplary flow):**
- system-patent-count (Ch1): Foundational overview with clear narrative arc from growth to peak to compositional shift.
- system-patent-law (Ch6): Chronological timeline provides natural structure. Academic citations integrated effectively.
- org-patent-count (Ch9): Compelling IBM-Samsung-Canon rivalry narrative woven through statistical analysis.

**Adequate (functional but could be enhanced):**
- geo-domestic (Ch18) and geo-international (Ch19): Competent but somewhat parallel structures with limited cross-referencing between domestic and international perspectives.
- mech-geography (Ch22): Dense statistical content; narrative thread less prominent than in other mechanics chapters.

## General Assessment

Narrative flow is ADEQUATE to STRONG across all chapters. Technology deep dives follow a consistent framework that aids reader navigation. System chapters build progressively. No chapters require structural reorganization.
