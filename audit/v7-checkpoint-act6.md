- **Cross-domain framework consistency:** All 12 deep dives follow the same structural template: overview, filing trends, organizational landscape, geographic distribution, subfield analysis, diversity index, and competitive dynamics. Consistent use of Pielou evenness (normalized Shannon entropy) as the "Diversity Index" across all 12.
- **CR4 superlatives verified:** Quantum Computing highest (33.8%), Biotechnology lowest (5.3%), Semiconductors only sustained consolidation, Blockchain only recent reversal -- all correct.
- **KeyFindings:** 12/12 present.
