## Mismatches Requiring Attention

### 1. Chapter 8 (org-composition): "1.45 million" vs "1.4 million"

- **Card description** (constants.ts line 70): `Japan accounts for 1.45 million US patents since 1976.`
- **Chapter page** (org-composition/page.tsx):
  - KeyFindings (line 116): `Japan accounts for 1.4 million US patents since 1976`
  - Executive Summary (line 122): `Japan (1.4 million cumulative patents)`
  - InsightRecap (line 378): `Japan accounting for 1.4 million US patents since 1976`
- **Nature:** The card says 1.45M but the chapter consistently says 1.4M. Either the card should be rounded to 1.4M to match the chapter, or the chapter should be updated to 1.45M to match the card. The chapter for geo-international (Ch19) also references "1.45 million" which matches the card -- so the discrepancy is within the org-composition chapter itself.
- **Recommendation:** Update the card to say "1.4 million" (matching the chapter page), or update the org-composition chapter to say "1.45 million" (matching the card and the geo-international chapter). The latter would provide consistency across Ch8, Ch12, and Ch19.

### 2. Chapter 12 (org-company-profiles): "6.7%" not in chapter page

- **Card description** (constants.ts line 98): `Amazon achieves the highest blockbuster patent rate at 6.7%`
- **Chapter page** (org-company-profiles/page.tsx): This number does not appear anywhere in the chapter page. It is sourced from Chapter 10 (org-patent-quality) and used in the card description to add specificity. The chapter is an interactive dashboard that dynamically loads company data -- no hardcoded statistics about specific companies appear in the prose.
- **Nature:** Cross-chapter reference. The card description cites a statistic from Chapter 10 to describe Chapter 12's content. The number is factually correct but is not verifiable from within the chapter page itself.
- **Recommendation:** Either (a) add a brief mention of Amazon's 6.7% blockbuster rate in the KeyFindings or Executive Summary of Ch12, or (b) remove this specific statistic from the card description and replace with a more general description.

### 3. Chapter 12 (org-company-profiles): "161,888" not in chapter page

- **Card description** (constants.ts line 98): `IBM leads in cumulative output with 161,888 grants`
- **Chapter page** (org-company-profiles/page.tsx): This number does not appear in the chapter page. It is sourced from Chapter 9 (org-patent-count). The chapter is an interactive dashboard; IBM's patent count would be dynamically computed from loaded JSON data.
- **Nature:** Cross-chapter reference, same as above.
- **Recommendation:** Same as for 6.7% -- either add these summary statistics to Ch12's prose or revise the card description.
