# TITLE_REVISIONS.md — Phase 5: Titles Audit

---

## NAMING CONVENTIONS (Phase 5b)

### ACT Titles
- **Pattern:** "The [Noun]" — 2-3 words, abstract thematic label
- **Current titles:** The System, The Actors, The Structure, The Mechanics, Deep Dives
- **Convention:** Keep the "The [Noun]" pattern for Acts 1-4. "Deep Dives" breaks the pattern but serves a different structural purpose (domain-specific chapters vs. cross-cutting chapters). Acceptable as-is.

### Chapter Titles
- **Pattern:** 2-5 words. Noun phrase identifying the subject domain. May include "&" for compound topics. No articles ("The") except where it reads naturally as a proper name (e.g., "The Inventors," "The Green Innovation Race").
- **Consistency:** Acts 1-4 chapters use longer, more evocative titles ("The Innovation Landscape," "The Technology Revolution"). Act 5 chapters use shorter, domain-label titles ("Semiconductors," "Cybersecurity"). This distinction is intentional — Acts 1-4 are narrative chapters while Act 5 chapters are analytical deep dives. No changes needed.

### Chapter Subtitles
- **Pattern:** Single descriptive phrase, 5-12 words, clarifying scope or analytical angle. Should not repeat the chapter title.

### Section Titles (SectionDivider labels)
- **Pattern:** 1-4 word topic labels within deep-dive chapters (Act 5); longer descriptive phrases in narrative chapters (Acts 1-4).
- **Consistency rule:** Within Act 5, all deep-dive chapters should use the same section labels for equivalent analyses (e.g., "Growth Trajectory" not sometimes "Growth" and sometimes "Growth Trajectory").

### Chart Titles (ChartContainer)
- **Pattern:** Finding-driven, specific, stating the key insight with data. 10-25 words. Includes specific numbers, percentages, or date ranges.
- **Convention:** Already well-established across all chapters. No changes needed.

### Terminology Standards
- **"Assignees"** (not "firms" or "companies") when referring to patent holders generically
- **"Inventors"** (not "researchers" or "scientists") for patent inventors
- **"Patents"** (not "filings" or "applications") when referring to granted patents
- **"CPC"** (not "IPC") for classification references
- **"Forward citations"** (not "citations received") for measuring impact
- **"Grant lag"** or **"pendency"** (not "processing time") for time to grant

## Phase 5c: PROPOSED TITLE CHANGES

### Pattern: Act 5 Deep Dive Section Standardization

The primary issue across Act 5 is **inconsistent generic section labels**. The same analysis type uses different labels across chapters. The fix is to standardize on a single label for each analysis type.

**Standardized section labels for Act 5 deep dives:**

| Analysis | Standard Label | Replaces |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Annual counts + share | Growth Trajectory | (already consistent) |
| Sub-category breakdown | [Domain] Subfields | "Subfields" (missing domain prefix in Ch 11, 12) |
| Top assignees | Leading Organizations | "Organizations" (too vague) |
| Org rankings heatmap | Organization Rankings Over Time | (already used in Ch 19, 22) |
| Top inventors | Top Inventors | "Inventors" (too vague) |
| Geographic distribution | Geographic Distribution | "Geography" (too vague) |
| Quality metrics | Quality Indicators | (already consistent) |
| Team size | Team Composition | "Team Size," "Team Size Comparison," "Assignee Type" variations |
| Assignee type | Assignee Type Distribution | "Assignee Type" (missing "Distribution" in Ch 11) |
| Strategies table | [Domain] Patenting Strategies | (already consistent) |
| Cross-domain | Cross-Domain Diffusion | (already consistent) |

### Changes to Implement

#### Chapter 3: The Language of Innovation

**Section: "Emerging Themes" → "Topic Trends Over Time"**
- Problem: Vague — doesn't specify what themes or how they're identified
- Rationale: The section shows NMF topic shares over time; new title specifies this

**Section: "The Patent Landscape" → "Topic Map"**
- Problem: Extremely generic — "patent landscape" could describe the entire site
- Rationale: The section shows a UMAP projection of patent topics; new title is specific

**Section: "Topics and Technology" → "Topics Across Technology Sections"**
- Problem: Vague — doesn't convey what relationship is being examined
- Rationale: The section examines how NMF topics distribute across CPC sections

#### Chapter 5: Firm Innovation

**Section: "Patent Portfolio Diversity" → Remove duplicate; merge into "Technology Portfolios"**
- Problem: Redundant with "Technology Portfolios"
- Note: Only rename if these are genuinely separate sections covering different content. If they cover distinct analyses, keep both but clarify titles.

**Section: "Firm Quality Typology" → "Quality Typology"**
- Problem: Partially redundant with "Innovation Quality Profiles"
- Rationale: Shortened to reduce overlap; the chapter context makes "Firm" implicit

**Section: "Portfolio Diversification" → Merge content into "Technology Portfolios" section or rename to "Diversification Trends"**
- Problem: Redundant with two other portfolio-related sections

**Section: "Knowledge Flows & Citations" → "Citation Networks"**
- Problem: Overlaps with "Citation Impact"
- Rationale: Distinguishes this section (network-level flows) from "Citation Impact" (patent-level metrics)

**Section: "Corporate Technology Portfolios" → Merge into "Technology Portfolios" or rename to "Portfolio Composition Over Time"**
- Problem: Nearly identical to "Technology Portfolios"

#### Chapter 6: The Inventors

**Section: "Gender" → "Gender Composition"**
- Problem: Single word is too vague as a section label
- Rationale: Specifies what aspect of gender is being examined

**Section: "Inventor Career Trajectories" → Verify distinct from "Career Longevity"; if overlapping, merge**
- Problem: May be redundant with "Career Longevity"

#### Act 5 Chapters (11-22): Generic Label Standardization

The following changes apply across ALL Act 5 chapters where the generic label appears:

**"Subfields" → "[Domain] Subfields"** (Chapters 11, 12 only — others already prefixed)
- Ch 11: "Subfields" → "Semiconductor Subfields"
- Ch 12: "Subfields" → "Quantum Computing Subfields"

**"Organizations" → "Leading Organizations"** (all Act 5 chapters using bare "Organizations")
- Applies to: Ch 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

**"Inventors" → "Top Inventors"** (all Act 5 chapters using bare "Inventors")
- Applies to: Ch 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

**"Geography" → "Geographic Distribution"** (all Act 5 chapters using bare "Geography")
- Applies to: Ch 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

**"Team Size" → "Team Composition"** (Chapter 11 only)
- Ch 11: "Team Size" → "Team Composition"

**"Assignee Type" → "Assignee Type Distribution"** (Chapter 11 only)
- Ch 11: "Assignee Type" → "Assignee Type Distribution"

**Total changes: 42 section title updates**

No ACT title, chapter title, or chapter subtitle changes required — all are appropriate and consistent.

No slug changes required — all URL slugs are descriptive and keyword-rich.

### Items NOT Changed (Flagged but Retained)

- **Ch 5 section redundancy** ("Technology Portfolios" / "Patent Portfolio Diversity" / "Portfolio Diversification" / "Corporate Technology Portfolios"): These sections likely cover distinct analyses despite similar names. Renaming requires reading the full content of each section. Flagged for review but not changed to avoid breaking content that may be distinct.

- **Ch 6 "Inventor Career Trajectories" vs. "Career Longevity"**: May cover distinct analyses. Flagged for review.
